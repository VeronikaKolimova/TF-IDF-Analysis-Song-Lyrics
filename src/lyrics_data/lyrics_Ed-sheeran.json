The lyrics depict a man and woman meeting in an Irish pub and dancing and singing the night away.\n\nIn his interview for… \nRead More\n \n[Chorus]\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just wanna dance\"\n[Verse 1]\nI met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar\nShe shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar\nShe asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?\nSaid it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?\nShe took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun\nShe got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun\nChatted some more, one more drink at the bar\nThen put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance\n[Chorus]\nYou know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just wanna dance\"\nWith my pretty little Galway Girl\nYou're my pretty little Galway Girl\n[Verse 2]\nYou know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool\nAnd then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room\nAs last orders were called was when she stood on the stool\nAfter dancing the céili singing to trad tunes\nI never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet\nA cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat\nOh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week\nAnd in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me\n[Chorus]\nYou know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just wanna dance\"\nMy pretty little Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\n[Verse 3]\nAnd now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time\nI was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine\nOur coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine\nAs we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night\nI walked her home then she took me inside\nTo finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine\nI swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write\nAbout a Galway Girl and a perfect night\n[Chorus]\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\nBut she fell in love with an English man\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\nSaid, \"Baby, I just wanna dance\"\nMy pretty little Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl (Hey)"
