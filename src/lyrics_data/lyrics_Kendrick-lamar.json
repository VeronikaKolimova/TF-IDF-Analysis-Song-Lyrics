3]\nDear baby girl\nI'm sorry that your father not active inside your world\nHe don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure\nHe a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs\nTry destroyin' families rather than taking care of his own\nShould be teaching you time tables or watchin' \nFrozen\n with you\nOr at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you\nInstead, he be in Turks

personas\nCan't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?\nYou embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in\n'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"
