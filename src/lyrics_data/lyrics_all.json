somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n[Chorus]\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, \nyour cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the\n \ntee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got \nlost in translation\n, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it"

should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest they life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualize 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'\nFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose\nI been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil'

3]\nDear baby girl\nI'm sorry that your father not active inside your world\nHe don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure\nHe a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs\nTry destroyin' families rather than taking care of his own\nShould be teaching you time tables or watchin' \nFrozen\n with you\nOr at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you\nInstead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve\nI wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind\nYou got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind\n'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion\nMoney's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to\nHis father prolly didn't claim him neither\nHistory do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason\nBut I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child\nGive him grace, this the reason I made \nMr. Morale\nSo our babies like you can cope later\nGive you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later\nI never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior\nSittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation\nYou need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain\nI'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains\nYes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right\nAnd a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say \"more life\"\nMeet the Grahams\n[Verse 4]\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party\nBut truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body\nThis supposed to be a good exhibition within the game\nBut you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name\nWhy you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?\nGuess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you\nAnd I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home\nThirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old\nYou got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems\nBad with money, whorehouse\nSolicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start\nBut I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom\nI try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'\nCrave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'\nNo dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in\nNo secret handshakes with your friend\nNo culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother\nIdentity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya\nThe skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas\nCan't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?\nYou embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in\n'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"

There won't be no next time!\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, \nI know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—\n[Chorus: Rihanna]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie"

Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily fast.\n\nIn a Q&A with Rolling Stone… \nRead More\n \n[Intro]\n\"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\"\n\"But I'm only going to get this one chance\"\n \n(\nSix minutes—, six minutes—\n)\n\"Something's wrong, I can feel it\"\n \n(\nSix minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!\n)\n\"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. \nIf that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; \nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\"\n\"You are just what the doc ordered\"\n[Chorus]\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot\n[Verse 1]\nBut for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a livin' and a killin' off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (\nKill 'em all with\n)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match\nWith this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'\nBackpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nAnd at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\n[Verse 2]\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)\nMCs get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, \nthey got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of \nshame\nYou fags think it's all a game,\n \n'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and,\n \ntell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)\nYou're witnessin' a mass-occur\nLike you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\n\"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"—that's all they say, lookin' boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy\nHey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy\nI'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit\nGet outta my face, lookin' boy!\nBasically, boy, you're never gonna be capable\nOf keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—\n[Chorus]\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod\nThis planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard\n[Verse 3]\nSo you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off, then I'm reloadin'\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'\nBut I got your mom deep-throatin'\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothin' in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes\nTo maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case 'cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come tryin'\nTo censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from \nThe Mathers LP 1\n when I\nTried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was,\n \nbut I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya,\n \nlike when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (\nJ.J. Fad\n)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,\n \nyou assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\n \nso that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock,\n \nshock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues,\n \nbut it's still tongue-in-cheek,\n \nfuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for \nSatan\nIt's a fatal mistake\n \nif you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard—be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?"

Everybody's jokin' now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow\nSnap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity\nOpe, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad\nBut he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it\nHe knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter\nHe's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant\nHe knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody\nBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n[Chorus]\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n[Verse 2]\nHis soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\nAs we move toward a new world order\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's\nClose to post-mortem, it only grows harder\nHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over\nThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows\nHe's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads\nGod only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose-dove and sold nada,\n \nand so the soap opera\nIs told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner\nBut the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah\n[Chorus]\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n[Verse 3]\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my nine-to-\nFive and I can't provide the right type of life for my family\n'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder\nTryna feed and water my seed,\n \nplus teeter-totter\nCaught up between bein' a father and a prima donna\nBaby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\nTo the point I'm like a snail, I've got\nTo formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got\nTo go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot\nSo here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n[Chorus]\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n[Outro]\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, \ntwo little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\n[Chorus]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n[Verse 2]\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\nSo Mama moved back onto Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\nAnd Mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh, Mama's only gone for the moment\n[Chorus]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n[Outro]\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat,\n \ndon't fuck with Dad\n \n(Haha)"

I'm tryna talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\n[Chorus: Dido]\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was, it was you\nDamn"

How do you lie?)\nOh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill\nCan't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will\nWent for me and not her\n'Cause girls your age know better\n[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire\n[Bridge]\n(Ah)\nYou said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?\nYou can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart\nI tried to help you out, now I know that I can't\n'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand\n[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire"
